        - [ ] Poly count optimized. (eg. less than 5k poly)
        - [ ] Model normals correct.
        - [ ] The model contains UV mapping.
        - [ ] UV islands created as needed.
        - [ ] Set the pivot point of the model to the correct location (often bottom center)
        - [ ] Align the pivot point of the model to the world origin.
        - [ ] Model facing direction __Positive-Y direction__
        - [ ] Model is the correct __dimentions__ as defined above.
        - [ ] The model is saved in `.fbx` file format.
        - [ ] The model is prefixed with SK_
        - [ ] The model is saved to the specified directory: `{save_directory}`.
        - [ ] The model is saved with the specified name: `{file_name}`
        - [ ] A pull request (PR) is created with the changes.
